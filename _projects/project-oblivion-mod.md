Oblivion Mod - The Curious Case of the Cabbage
==============================================

The Curious Case of the Cabbage is an Oblivion mod made over the course of several weeks for a University unit in which we focused on and made use of the Waterfall development methodology.
For the project, my team and I decided on making up a small questline which would allow for multiple ending choices from the player at any point and provide dialogue options and quest endings based on the player's actions of how they chose to end it. The repo of my development contribution can be found here: [Oblivion Mod Repo](https://github.com/Chi-Time/DAC515-Oblivion-Mod/tree/dev) The mod itself can be downloaded and played from here: [Nexus Mods Page]()


If during the middle of the quest the player chooses to kill an important character then the rest of them will respond in turn about that information and the quest will be marked as complete with a note of that more could be done. This goes for a vast number of routes we made for it.
